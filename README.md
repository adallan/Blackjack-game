# Blackjack-game
A blackjack game made using C++ and hosted in browser via web assembly and JavaScript.

Please see: [game_logic.cpp](https://github.com/adallan/Blackjack-game/blob/main/game_logic.cpp) for the C++ game code!

## Currently working on the following next steps:
- Converting C++ logic to web assembly.
- Web assembly testing.
- After JavaScript and Html/browser intergration.
- Browser testing.
