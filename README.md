# Blackjack-game
A blackjack game made using C++ and hosted in browser via web assembly and JavaScript.

Please see: [game_logic.cpp](https://github.com/adallan/Blackjack-game/blob/main/game_logic.cpp) for the C++ text based-game code!
See [here](https://github.com/adallan/Blackjack-game/blob/main/game_logic_bindings.cpp) for the C++ Web Assembly bindings for JavaScript to use to run the game in a browser.

## Currently working on the following next steps:
- Converting C++ logic to web assembly.       Done!
- Web assembly testing.       Currently ongoing ...
- After JavaScript and Html/browser intergration.    Currently Starting.
- Browser testing.

Thanks for reading!
